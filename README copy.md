Homework #1

I created this webpage using html and css. The three buttons in the navbar
are linked to a different page. The contact button will allow you to leave me message if you need to get a hold of me for any reason. The portfolio page will show you some previous projects I have worked on. The about me button will bring you back to the homepage.
